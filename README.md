# Hi! I'm Umreen :wave:

### Allow me to introduce myself: 
##### I'm a data analyst and full stack web developer. I've always been a "gut follower," and my previous experiences have shaped who I am and the work I do today. My passion for analytics and exploring large amounts of data to create helpful, meaningful, and creative visualizations led me to go back to school for a Masters in Data Analytics.  Although I love analytics, I will always have a passion for creating web applications (#TeamPython & #TeamJavaScript). I enjoy all aspects of designing an application, and get very excited to collaborate and discuss ideas with others to build and deliver unique products!
