# Hi! I'm Umreen :wave:

### Allow me to introduce myself: 
##### I'm a data analyst and full stack web developer. I've always been a "gut follower," and my previous experiences have shaped who I am and the work I do today. My passion for analytics and exploring large amounts of data to create helpful, meaningful, and creative visualizations led me to go back to school for a Masters in Data Analytics.  Although I love analytics, I will always have a passion for creating web applications (#TeamPython & #TeamJavaScript). I enjoy all aspects of designing an application, and get very excited to collaborate and discuss ideas with others to build and deliver unique products! In my free time you can find me dj-ing, playing with my puppy, or building keyboards!
